**Project Title: "Global Trends in Music Popularity"**

We will use Kaggle's "Top Spotify Songs in 73 Countries (Daily Updated)" dataset. This dataset is updated daily to include the top songs and artists streamed across the world. We are interested in answering some of the following questions:

- Which songs and artists are most popular in which countries?
- Which country listens to the most danceable and acoustic music? How does this compare between countries?
- Do countries prefer explicit music or non explicit music?
