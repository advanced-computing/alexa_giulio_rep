**Project Title: "Global Trends in Music Popularity"**

We will use Kaggle's "Top Spotify Songs in 73 Countries (Daily Updated)" dataset. This dataset is updated daily to include the top songs and artists streamed across the world. We are interested in answering some of the following questions:

- Which genres of music and artists are most popular in which countries?
- Which country listens to the most music?
- Do countries tend to listen to domestic music (i.e. music produced in the user's country or sung in the home language) more than foreign music? 
- Which songs/artists are most popular and when do they start to lose popularity?


**Setup/usage instructions**
Depending on which research question we choose, we have several ideas for how to graph this data (such as a cloropleth map of artist popularity across the world or a word cluster chart that shows the name of the most popular artists globally). If we for instance choose to do a line graph of song/artist popularity over time (where each line represents one song or artist), then our target visualization could look like this:
